# Password-Based Protection System using 8051 Microcontroller


## Description

This project implements a Password-Based Protection System using an 8051 microcontroller, Embedded C language, a keypad, and an LCD display. The system offers a secure way to
 control access to a device or area by requiring users to input a correct password on the keypad. If the entered password matches the pre-set password, the system grants access,
 and the user is notified through the LCD display. Otherwise, access is denied.

## Components Used

- 8051 Microcontroller (e.g., AT89S52)
- Keypad
- LCD Display 
- Connecting Wires

## Features

- Secure password-based access control system.
- Supports customizable password setting for different security levels.
- User-friendly interface through the keypad and LCD display.
- Efficiently coded in Embedded C language for optimal microcontroller utilization.
